Aerospace Universal Mission Control Interface
This is a webapp to be used during aerospace missions as the mission control interface, and after the missions as a data visualization and analysis tool.
The backend is a mix of pure NodeJS and Express, using MongoDB. The frontend is mostly JQuery, so far.
